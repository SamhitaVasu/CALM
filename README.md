# Make America Human Again

> "It's just a matter of time before 100% of our jobs today are replaced by machines."
  ~ John Hagel

> "The most valuable skills will be the ones that are uniquely human, that computers cannot quite figure out."
  ~ Fareed Zakaria
  
> "Knowledge Economy as we know it is being eclipsed by something new -- call it the Creative Economy."
  ~ Bruce Nussbaum

Machines are beginning to take over the workforce. Merely acquiring, practicing, and applying many new skills and knowledge will no longer be enough. We need to develop the qualities that make us *uniquely human*, such as *creativity*, *imagination*, and *curiosity*. *Cognitive fluidity* is the golden braid that connects these qualities. **CALM provides various research-backed tools to develop and exercise cognitive fluidity.**
